    <p>This is a picture from when I was still working on my associates degree!
Here I was "lapping" the scope rings you can see on my AR-15. Lapping is a process
where a gritty compound is used in conjunction with friction to "true" a surface.
It is basically a sandpaper paste. I had installed a large metal rod the same way
I would have an actual telescopic sight. The only difference being, I applied a
liberal amount of lapping compound to the inside of the rings.
I then threaded the handle you can see in front of my right hand.
From here I rotated the rod several times, being sure to also move it forward and back
until I felt enough material had been removed. The purpose of this procedure is to ensure
both scope rings are true (also described as "square") with each other. Doing this will remove
some differential stress points between each ring which could have affected accuracy.
In short, scope ring lapping (most lapping jobs when related to firearms) improves accuracy.
As a side note, lapping can be done to many parts of a firearm!</p>

    <p>These are my dogs! From left to right, their names are Jaeger, Tyr and Ranger.
Jaeger sadly passed away about a year and a half ago, he was a GIANT Newfoundland, Awkbash mix.
Tyr is a Catahoula, Beagle mix, he was supposed to act as my husbandâ€™s new service dog since Jaeger
was starting to slow down at the time. However, he is so independent that we had to wash him out.
Thankfully he has still become an essential part of our family. Ranger is a Doberman, Black & tan hound mix.
He is also my service dog prospect; I have been training him and while his Velcro personality can be a bit much,
I would not have any other dog at this point in my life.</p>
